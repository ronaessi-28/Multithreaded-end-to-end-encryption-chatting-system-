# Multithreaded End-to-End Encrypted Cryptography-Based Real-Time Chat Application

This Java-based chat application allows two clients to communicate securely via LAN or Wi-Fi using RSA encryption. The server facilitates connections but cannot decipher messages between clients.

## Features
- End-to-end encryption using RSA.
- Secure chat between two clients.
- Multithreaded server capable of handling multiple connections.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher.
- LAN or Wi-Fi for offline communication.

### Modules:
- `java.net.*` - Networking interface for sockets.
- `java.io.*` - Stream handling.
- `java.math.BigInteger` - Handles large integers for RSA encryption.
- `java.util.Random` - For prime number generation in RSA.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone
